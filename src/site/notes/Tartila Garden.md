# Tartila Garden

## Ideas wander, drift, and roam.
##### <font color=green> This little garden gives them a home. </font>

This is my digital garden—a public notebook of notes, reflections,
and small experiments while learning tajwid, tahsin, and memorizing the Qur’an.

Nothing here is final.
Some ideas will change.
Some notes will grow.
This space evolves as I learn.

What grows in this garden

- Tajwid and tahsin notes
- Reflections from learning and teaching
- Memorization methods and observations
- Unfinished thoughts worth revisiting
